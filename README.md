Hello everyone! My name is Melissa Collin. I am a student at Humboldt State University majoring in Environmental Science and Management with a focus in Geospatail Science.  I'm currently enrolled in Cartography, Intermediate GIS, Intermediate Remote Sensing, and Natural History and Ecology. In my free time I like to read, cook, and do anything outdoors.
